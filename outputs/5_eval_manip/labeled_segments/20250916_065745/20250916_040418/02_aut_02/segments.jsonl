  "text": "that's an unusual use. \n\nAnother thought: using the toothbrush as a tool for applying or spreading substances, like makeup or eye shadow. The bristles could act as a small brush. \n\nOr using the handle as a tool for opening small containers that are stuck, like prying open a jar lid slightly. \n\nHmm, I should make sure these are all safe and not damaging.
