  "prompt": "List as many unusual and creative uses as possible for a paper cup. Provide the final answer as a numbered list.",
  "final_answer": "Hereâ€™s a numbered list of unusual and creative uses for a paper cup:\n\n1. **Temporary Flower Pot** â€“ Plant seeds or small herbs in the cup, punch drainage holes, and transplant the whole cup into soil later.  \n2. **DIY Candle Mold** â€“ Pour melted wax into the cup and let it harden for a simple candle.  \n3. **Miniature Drum** â€“ Stretch a balloon or plastic wrap over the open end and use it as a makeshift drum.  \n4. **Bird Feeder** â€“ Punch holes around the top, thread string through, and smear peanut butter and seeds on the inside.  \n5. **Science Experiment Funnel** â€“ Cut off the bottom to create a funnel for pouring liquids or mixing chemicals.  \n6. **Solar Oven** â€“ Line the cup with aluminum foil and use it to focus sunlight for melting chocolate or sâ€™mores.  \n7. **Seed Starter** â€“ Use it to germinate seeds before transplanting them into the ground.  \n8. **DIY Musical Shaker** â€“ Fill with rice or beads and seal the top for a handheld instrument.  \n9. **Temporary Bowl** â€“ Use as a mixing container for small recipes or craft projects.  \n10. **Pet Food Container** â€“ Hold kibble or treats for small animals like hamsters or birds.  \n11. **Mini Greenhouse** â€“ Cover the cup with plastic wrap and place a small plant inside to trap moisture.  \n12. **DIY Wind Chime** â€“ Hang multiple cups with strings and add beads for a wind chime.  \n13. **Pencil Holder** â€“ Stack cups or use them to organize small office supplies.  \n14. **Art Stencil** â€“ Cut shapes into the cup and use it as a stencil for painting or drawing.  \n15. **Ice Cube Mold** â€“ Freeze water in the cup for uniquely shaped ice cubes.  \n16. **Time Capsule** â€“ Bury the cup with small mementos to open later.  \n17. **DIY Bird Bath** â€“ Fill with water and hang it for birds to drink or bathe.  \n18. **Puppet Craft** â€“ Turn the cup into a hand puppet by adding paint, fabric, or googly eyes.  \n19. **Miniature Lampshade** â€“ Paint or decorate the cup and use it as a shade for a small LED light.  \n20. **Rocket Body** â€“ Use as a base for a baking soda and vinegar-powered rocket.  \n21. **Temporary Hat** â€“ Wear it as a novelty hat or part of a costume.  \n22. **DIY Windsock** â€“ Attach the cup to a stick and add fabric for a wind-catching decoration.  \n23. **Concrete Sculpture Mold** â€“ Pour wet concrete into the cup to create a small, cup-shaped sculpture.  \n24. **Paint Palette** â€“ Use the cup to hold small amounts of paint for watercolor or acrylics.  \n25. **Mini Aquarium** â€“ Line with plastic and use it as a temporary home for tiny aquatic creatures.  \n\nLet me know if youâ€™d like more ideas! ðŸŒŸ",
