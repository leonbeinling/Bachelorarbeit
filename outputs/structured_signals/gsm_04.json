        "text": "Let me check that again. If yesterday was 12, then twice that is 24. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nSo, total pages read so far would be yesterday's 12 plus today's 24. Let me add those up. 12 + 24 is 36 pages. So she's read 36 pages in total. The book is 120 pages, so the remaining pages would be 120 minus 36. Let me calculate that. 120 - 36... 120 minus 30 is 90, minus 6 more is 84. So there are 84 pages left.\n\nNow, the question says she wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow. So half of 84. Let me divide that by 2. 84 divided by 2 is 42. So she should read 42 pages tomorrow. Wait, let me just verify each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nTotal pages: 120. Pages read yesterday: 12. Pages read today: 2*12=24. Total read: 12+24=36. Remaining pages: 120-36=84. Half of remaining: 84/2=42. Yeah, that seems correct. I don't think I missed anything here. The numbers add up. So the answer should be 42 pages.\n\n"
