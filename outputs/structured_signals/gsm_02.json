So I need to calculate the fraction of an hour that 50 minutes represents and then multiply that by her hourly rate to get the total earnings.\n\nHmm, how do I convert 50 minutes into hours? Well, there are 60 minutes in an hour, right? So 50 minutes is 50/60 of an hour. Let me write that down: 50 divided by 60. Maybe I can simplify that fraction. Both 50 and 60 are divisible by 10, so dividing numerator and denominator by 10 gives 5/6. So 50 minutes is 5/6 of an hour. That seems right because 60 minutes is a full hour, so 50 minutes is just 10 minutes less than an hour. 10 minutes is 1/6 of an hour, so subtracting that from 1 gives 5/6. Yeah, that checks out.\n\nNow, to find out how much she earned, I need to multiply her hourly rate by the number of hours she worked. So that would be $12 multiplied by 5/6. Let me do that calculation. 12 times 5 is 60, and then divided by 6. So 60 divided by 6 is 10. So does that mean she earned $10? Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me verify.\n\n"

        "text": "That seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in my calculations. Let me go through the first method again. 50 minutes is 5/6 of an hour. 5 divided by 6 is approximately 0.8333... hours. Then multiplying that by $12 per hour: 12 * 0.8333... Let me compute that. 12 * 0.8 is 9.6, and 12 * 0.0333... is approximately 0.4. Adding those together gives 9.6 + 0.4 = 10. So that's $10 again. Okay, so that's the same result. So that seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: If she worked 60 minutes, she would earn $12. So for each minute, it's $12/60 = $0.20 per minute. Then 50 minutes would be 50 * $0.20 = $10. Yep, same answer. So all methods lead to $10. Therefore, I think that's the right answer.\n\nBut let me check if there's any possibility "
