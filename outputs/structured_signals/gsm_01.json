So April = 48 clips. "

        "text": "Got that part. Now, May is a bit trickier. It says she sold half as many clips in May as she did in April. So, half of April's sales. Let me write that down. May = half of April's 48 clips. To find half of 48, I need to divide 48 by 2. Let me do that calculation. 48 divided by 2 is... 24. So May's sales are 24 clips.\n\nNow, to find the total number of clips sold in both months, I need to add April's and May's sales together. That would be 48 (April) plus 24 (May). Let me add those numbers. 48 + 24... Hmm, 48 plus 20 is 68, and then plus 4 more is 72. So altogether, Natalia sold 72 clips in April and May.\n\nWait, let me double-check my math to make sure I didn't make a mistake. April is 48, half of that is 24 for May. Adding 48 and 24: 48 + 24. Breaking it down, 40 + 20 is 60, and 8 + 4 is 12. Then 60 + 12 is 72. Yep, that checks out. So the total is indeed 72. \n\nIs there another way to approach this? Maybe by using fractions? "

        "text": "Okay, so that seems consistent. \n\nI guess another thing to consider is whether \"half as many\" is correctly interpreted here. Sometimes in word problems, phrases can be tricky. But in this case, \"half as many clips in May\" compared to April, so it's definitely half of April's amount. So 48 divided by 2 is 24. \n\nNo, I don't think there's any ambiguity here. The problem states she sold half as many in May as in April. So the calculation is straightforward. \n\nTherefore, adding both months together gives 72. I think that's the correct answer. Let me just visualize it. If April is 48, and May is half that, so 24, then the total is like 48 + 24. Yeah, 72. \n\nI don't see any other factors mentioned in the problem. There's no mention of other months or different rates. It's just April and May. So Natalia sold 48 in April, 24 in May, total 72. Yep, that seems right. \n\nI think that's all there is to it. The key steps were identifying May's sales as half of April's, performing the division to find May's amount, then adding them together. The arithmetic checks out, and the interpretation of the problem seems correct. So I feel confident that 72 is the right answer.\n\n"
