So per week, it's 2 sessions. Therefore, weekly pages would be 6 pages per session times 2 sessions per week. That would be 6 * 2 = 12 pages per week. "

Hmm, 10*52 is 520, and 2*52 is 104, so adding those together gives 520 + 104 = 624. So 624 pages per year?\n\nWait, let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't skip anything or miscalculate.\n\nFirst, per session: 2 friends * 3 pages = 6 pages. Then twice a week: 6 * 2 = 12 pages per week. Then 12 * 52 weeks. 12*50 is 600, and 12*2 is 24, so 600 + 24 = 624. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nIs there another way to approach this? "

He writes 2 letters per session (since he writes to 2 friends), twice a week. So letters per week: 2 * 2 = 4 letters per week. Then per year: 4 letters/week * 52 weeks = 208 letters. Each letter is 3 pages, so 208 * 3 = 624 pages. Yep, same answer. "
