  "prompt": "In a lake, there is a patch of lily pads. Every day, the patch doubles in size. If it takes 48 days for the patch to cover the entire lake, how long would it take for the patch to cover half of the lake?",
  "final_answer": "To solve the problem, we need to understand the nature of the lily pad's growth. The key detail is that the patch **doubles in size every day**. This is a classic example of **exponential growth**, where the size of the patch on any given day is twice what it was the day before.\n\n---\n\n### Understanding the Growth Pattern\n\nLetâ€™s denote the total area of the lake as $ L $, and the size of the lily pad patch on day $ n $ as $ S(n) $. Since the patch doubles in size each day, we can express the size of the patch on day $ n $ as:\n\n$$\nS(n) = S(1) \\cdot 2^{n-1}\n$$\n\nWe are told that on day 48, the patch covers the entire lake:\n\n$$\nS(48) = L\n$$\n\nThis implies:\n\n$$\nS(1) \\cdot 2^{47} = L \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad S(1) = \\frac{L}{2^{47}}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Finding the Day When the Patch Covers Half the Lake\n\nWe now want to find the day $ n $ when the patch covers **half** the lake, i.e., $ S(n) = \\frac{L}{2} $. Using the formula:\n\n$$\nS(n) = \\frac{L}{2^{47}} \\cdot 2^{n-1} = \\frac{L}{2}\n$$\n\nDivide both sides by $ L $:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2^{47}} \\cdot 2^{n-1} = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\n\nMultiply both sides by $ 2^{47} $:\n\n$$\n2^{n-1} = 2^{46}\n$$\n\nSince the bases are the same, we can equate the exponents:\n\n$$\nn - 1 = 46 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad n = 47\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\nTherefore, the lily pad patch would cover **half** of the lake on **day 47**.\n\n$$\n\\boxed{47}\n$$<|im_end|>",

That means each day, the area covered is twice what it was the day before. \n\nNow, if the entire lake is covered on day 48, then the day before that, on day 47, the patch must have been half the size of the lake. Because if it doubles every day, then on day 48 it's double what it was on day 47. Therefore, if day 48 is 100% coverage, day 47 must be 50% coverage. \n\nWait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check if I'm missing something. Maybe I need to model it mathematically. Let's say the size of the patch on day n is S(n). According to the problem, S(n) = S(n-1) * 2. \n\n"

So in general, S(n) = x * 2^(n-1). \n\nBut we know that on day 48, the patch covers the entire lake. Let's denote the area of the lake as L. Therefore, S(48) = x * 2^(48-1) = x * 2^47 = L. \n\nSo, solving for x, we get x = L / 2^47. \n\nNow, we need to find the day when the patch covers half the lake, which is L/2. Let's set S(n) = L/2. \n\nSo, x * 2^(n-1) = L/2. \n\nSubstituting x from above: (L / 2^47) * 2^(n-1) = L/2. \n\nWe can divide both sides by L to simplify: (1 / 2^47) * 2^(n-1) = 1/2. \n\nMultiplying both sides by 2^47: 2^(n-1) = 2^46. \n\nSince the bases are the same, we can set the exponents equal: n - 1 = 46. \n\nTherefore, n = 47. \n\nSo, that confirms my initial thought. On day 47, the lily pad patch covers half the lake. \n\nBut let me think again to make sure. If on day 47 it's half the lake, then on day 48 it doubles to cover the whole lake. That makes sense. "

        "text": "Yeah, that seems consistent. Maybe some people might think that if it takes 48 days to cover the lake, then half coverage would take half the time, like 24 days? But that would be the case if the growth was linear, not exponential. But since it's exponential, the time to reach half coverage is just one day less than full coverage. \n\nLet me test this with smaller numbers to verify. Suppose the lake is covered on day 3. Then, working backwards, day 3 is full, day 2 is half, day 1 is a quarter. Let's check with the formula. If n=3, then x*2^(3-1)=x*4=L. So x=L/4. Then, when does it reach L/2? Solve x*2^(n-1)=L/2. Substitute x: (L/4)*2^(n-1)=L/2. Divide both sides by L: (1/4)*2^(n-1)=1/2. Multiply both sides by 4: 2^(n-1)=2. Therefore, n-1=1, so n=2. Which is indeed one day before full coverage. So that works. \n\nAnother example: if the lake is covered on day 2, then day 1 is half. Using formula: x*2^(2-1)=x*2=L => x=L/2. Solve for half coverage: x*2^(n-1)=L/2 => (L/2)*2^(n-1)=L/2 => 2^(n-1)=1 => n-1=0 => n=1. Correct again. \n\nTherefore, the pattern holds. So, applying this to day 48, "
