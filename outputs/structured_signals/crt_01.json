  "prompt": "A bat and a ball cost $1.10 in total. The bat costs $1.00 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?",
  "final_answer": "To solve the problem, let's define the cost of the ball as $ x $ dollars. According to the problem, the bat costs **$1.00 more than the ball**, so the cost of the bat is $ x + 1.00 $ dollars. Together, the bat and the ball cost $1.10. This gives us the equation:\n\n$$\nx + (x + 1.00) = 1.10\n$$\n\nSimplifying the left-hand side:\n\n$$\n2x + 1.00 = 1.10\n$$\n\nNow, subtract 1.00 from both sides:\n\n$$\n2x = 0.10\n$$\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n$$\nx = 0.05\n$$\n\nSo, the ball costs **$0.05**, and the bat, being $1.00 more, costs **$1.05**. Adding these together:\n\n$$\n0.05 + 1.05 = 1.10\n$$\n\nThis confirms that the total is correct and that the bat is indeed $1.00 more than the ball.\n\n---\n\nIt's important to note that a common mistake is to assume the bat is $1.00 and the ball is $0.10, which would make the total $1.10, but the bat would only be $0.90 more than the ball. This violates the condition that the bat is **$1.00 more** than the ball.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nThe ball costs \\boxed{0.05} dollars.<|im_end|>",

        "text": "Let me see where that confusion might come from. If someone quickly reads the problem, they might think, \"Oh, the bat is $1.00 and the ball is $0.10, so together they make $1.10.\" But that would mean the bat is only $0.90 more than the ball ($1.00 - $0.10 = $0.90), which doesn't satisfy the condition that the bat is $1.00 more. So that's a common mistake. The key here is that the difference has to be exactly $1.00, not just the bat being $1.00 with an additional amount for the ball.\n\nLet me try another way to verify. Suppose the ball is $0.05. Then the bat is $0.05 + $1.00 = $1.05. Adding them together: $0.05 + $1.05 = $1.10. Perfect. If the ball were $0.10, then the bat would be $1.10 (since it's $1.00 more), and together they would cost $1.20, which is more than the given total. So that's not possible. Therefore, the correct answer must be $0.05 for the ball.\n\nAnother approach: Let me use algebra again but define variables more formally. Let the cost of the ball be x dollars. Then the bat's cost is x + 1. The total is 1.10. So:\n\nx + (x + 1) = 1.10 \nWhich simplifies to 2x + 1 = 1.10 \nSubtract 1: 2x = 0.10 \nDivide by 2: x = 0.05\n\nSame result. So that's consistent. Maybe I can also think in cents to avoid decimals. Let me convert everything to cents. The total is 110 cents. The bat is 100 cents more than the ball. Let the ball be y cents. Then the bat is y + 100 cents. Together:\n\ny + (y + 100) = 110 \n2y + 100 = 110 \n2y = 10 \ny = 5 cents. So the ball is 5 cents, bat is 105 cents. Yep, same answer.\n\nI think that's solid. The confusion comes from the intuitive but incorrect answer of 10 cents, which doesn't account for the fact that the $1.00 difference is in addition to the ball's cost. So when you say the bat is $1.00 more, you have to add that difference to the ball's price to get the bat's price, and then the total includes both the ball and the bat. Therefore, solving the equation properly gives the correct answer.\n\nLet me also think if there's another way someone might approach this problem. Maybe trial and error? Let's say trying different amounts. Suppose the ball is 5 cents, then bat is 105, total 110. That works. If the ball is 10 cents, bat is 110, total is 120. Too high. If the ball is 4 cents, bat is 104, total is 108. Too low. If the ball is 6 cents, bat is 106, total is 112. Too high. So 5 cents is the only one that hits 110. So trial and error also leads to 5 cents.\n\n"

        "text": "so splitting that as ball and bat. But that's not the right way. The problem is that the total is 1.10, and the bat is 1.00 more than the ball. So the relationship isn't just a difference in total, but a relative price.\n\nAnother common mistake is not considering that the $1.00 is in addition to the ball's price. So if the ball is x, the bat is x + 1.00, so total is x + x + 1.00 = 2x + 1.00. So solving 2x + 1.00 = 1.10 is correct. If someone instead sets up the equation as bat = total - ball, and bat = ball + 1.00, so substituting:\n\nball + 1.00 = 1.10 - ball \nThen adding ball to both sides: \n2 * ball + 1.00 = 1.10 \nWhich is the same equation as before. So solving that gives 2 * ball = 0.10 => ball = 0.05. So same result.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the method—algebra, trial and error, "
