        "text": "Betty wants to buy a wallet that costs $100. She has only half of the money she needs. Hmm, so if the wallet is $100, half of that would be $50. So Betty currently has $50 saved up. \n\nThen her parents decided to give her $15. And her grandparents are giving twice as much as her parents. So grandparents would give 2 times $15. Let me calculate that. 2 times 15 is $30. So her grandparents are giving her $30.\n\nNow, let's add up all the money she has. She had $50, her parents gave $15, and grandparents gave $30. So adding those together: 50 + 15 is 65, and 65 + 30 is 95. Wait, so Betty has $95 now?\n\nBut the wallet costs $100. So how much more does she need? Let me subtract. $100 minus $95 equals $5. So Betty needs $5 more?\n\nWait, let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake. The problem says she has half of the money she needs. The wallet is $100, so half is $50. Then parents give $15, grandparents twice as much as parents, so 15*2=30. So total money she has is 50+15+30=95. Then 100-95=5. Yeah, that seems right. So she needs $5 more. \n\nBut let me make sure there isn't a trick here. Sometimes problems have hidden details. "

        "text": "For example, does \"twice as much as her parents\" mean twice the total parents gave or each grandparent? But the problem says grandparents twice as much as her parents. Since it's plural grandparents, but it's possible they gave together twice as much as parents. The problem says \"twice as much as her parents,\" so probably the total from grandparents is $30. So yes, 15 from parents, 30 from grandparents. So total 45 from family. She had 50, so 50+45=95. 100-95=5. So answer is $5. \n\n"
