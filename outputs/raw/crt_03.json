If it takes 48 days for the patch to cover the entire lake, how long would it take for the patch to cover half of the lake?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out this lily pad problem. So, the question is: there's a patch of lily pads in a lake, and every day it doubles in size. It takes 48 days for the patch to cover the entire lake. The question is, how long would it take for the patch to cover half of the lake?\n\nHmm, let me think. The key here is that the lily pad patch doubles in size every day. So, if I understand correctly, the growth is exponential. That means each day, the area covered is twice what it was the day before. \n\nNow, if the entire lake is covered on day 48, then the day before that, on day 47, the patch must have been half the size of the lake. Because if it doubles every day, then on day 48 it's double what it was on day 47. Therefore, if day 48 is 100% coverage, day 47 must be 50% coverage. \n\nWait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check if I'm missing something. Maybe I need to model it mathematically. Let's say the size of the patch on day n is S(n). According to the problem, S(n) = S(n-1) * 2. \n\nAlternatively, we can express this with an exponential function. Let's assume that the initial size on day 1 is some value, say S(1) = x. Then on day 2, it's 2x, day 3 is 4x, day 4 is 8x, and so on. So in general, S(n) = x * 2^(n-1). \n\nBut we know that on day 48, the patch covers the entire lake. Let's denote the area of the lake as L. Therefore, S(48) = x * 2^(48-1) = x * 2^47 = L. \n\nSo, solving for x, we get x = L / 2^47. \n\nNow, we need to find the day when the patch covers half the lake, which is L/2. Let's set S(n) = L/2. \n\nSo, x * 2^(n-1) = L/2. \n\nSubstituting x from above: (L / 2^47) * 2^(n-1) = L/2. \n\nWe can divide both sides by L to simplify: (1 / 2^47) * 2^(n-1) = 1/2. \n\nMultiplying both sides by 2^47: 2^(n-1) = 2^46. \n\nSince the bases are the same, we can set the exponents equal: n - 1 = 46. \n\nTherefore, n = 47. \n\nSo, that confirms my initial thought. On day 47, the lily pad patch covers half the lake. \n\nBut let me think again to make sure. If on day 47 it's half the lake, then on day 48 it doubles to cover the whole lake. That makes sense. So the answer is 47 days. \n\nWait, but maybe there's a trick here? Sometimes these problems have tricks. For example, if the patch isn't starting from a single point or if there are multiple patches? But the problem says \"a patch of lily pads,\" implying a single patch. And it says the patch doubles in size every day. So, no, I think the logic holds. \n\nAnother way to think about it is to work backwards. If on day 48 the lake is fully covered, then the day before, it must have been half covered because doubling half covers the whole. Therefore, subtracting one day from 48 gives 47. \n\nYeah, that seems consistent. Maybe some people might think that if it takes 48 days to cover the lake, then half coverage would take half the time, like 24 days? But that would be the case if the growth was linear, not exponential. But since it's exponential, the time to reach half coverage is just one day less than full coverage. \n\nLet me test this with smaller numbers to verify. Suppose the lake is covered on day 3. Then, working backwards, day 3 is full, day 2 is half, day 1 is a quarter. Let's check with the formula. If n=3, then x*2^(3-1)=x*4=L. So x=L/4. Then, when does it reach L/2? Solve x*2^(n-1)=L/2. Substitute x: (L/4)*2^(n-1)=L/2. Divide both sides by L: (1/4)*2^(n-1)=1/2. Multiply both sides by 4: 2^(n-1)=2. Therefore, n-1=1, so n=2. Which is indeed one day before full coverage. So that works. \n\nAnother example: if the lake is covered on day 2, then day 1 is half. Using formula: x*2^(2-1)=x*2=L => x=L/2. Solve for half coverage: x*2^(n-1)=L/2 => (L/2)*2^(n-1)=L/2 => 2^(n-1)=1 => n-1=0 => n=1. Correct again. \n\nTherefore, the pattern holds. So, applying this to day 48, the answer is day 47. \n\nI think that's solid. The confusion might come from misunderstanding exponential growth, but with the mathematical model and examples, it seems clear. Therefore, the answer should be 47 days.\n\n**Final Answer**\nIt would take \\boxed{47} days for the patch to cover half of the lake.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to understand the nature of the lily pad's growth. The key detail is that the patch **doubles in size every day**. This is a classic example of **exponential growth**, where the size of the patch on any given day is twice what it was the day before.\n\n---\n\n### Understanding the Growth Pattern\n\nLet’s denote the total area of the lake as $ L $, and the size of the lily pad patch on day $ n $ as $ S(n) $. Since the patch doubles in size each day, we can express the size of the patch on day $ n $ as:\n\n$$\nS(n) = S(1) \\cdot 2^{n-1}\n$$\n\nWe are told that on day 48, the patch covers the entire lake:\n\n$$\nS(48) = L\n$$\n\nThis implies:\n\n$$\nS(1) \\cdot 2^{47} = L \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad S(1) = \\frac{L}{2^{47}}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Finding the Day When the Patch Covers Half the Lake\n\nWe now want to find the day $ n $ when the patch covers **half** the lake, i.e., $ S(n) = \\frac{L}{2} $.
