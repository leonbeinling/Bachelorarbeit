How much did she earn?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so Weng earns $12 an hour for babysitting, and she worked 50 minutes yesterday. I need to figure out how much she earned. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that her hourly rate is $12 per hour. But she didn't work a full hour; she only worked 50 minutes. So I need to calculate the fraction of an hour that 50 minutes represents and then multiply that by her hourly rate to get the total earnings.\n\nHmm, how do I convert 50 minutes into hours? Well, there are 60 minutes in an hour, right? So 50 minutes is 50/60 of an hour. Let me write that down: 50 divided by 60. Maybe I can simplify that fraction. Both 50 and 60 are divisible by 10, so dividing numerator and denominator by 10 gives 5/6. So 50 minutes is 5/6 of an hour. That seems right because 60 minutes is a full hour, so 50 minutes is just 10 minutes less than an hour. 10 minutes is 1/6 of an hour, so subtracting that from 1 gives 5/6. Yeah, that checks out.\n\nNow, to find out how much she earned, I need to multiply her hourly rate by the number of hours she worked. So that would be $12 multiplied by 5/6. Let me do that calculation. 12 times 5 is 60, and then divided by 6. So 60 divided by 6 is 10. So does that mean she earned $10? Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me verify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it in terms of minutes. If she earns $12 per hour, then per minute, she would earn $12 divided by 60 minutes. Let me calculate that. 12 divided by 60 is 0.2 dollars per minute, which is 20 cents per minute. Then, if she worked 50 minutes, multiplying 50 minutes by $0.2 per minute would be 50 * 0.2 = $10. So that also gives me $10. Okay, so both methods give me the same answer. That seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in my calculations. Let me go through the first method again. 50 minutes is 5/6 of an hour. 5 divided by 6 is approximately 0.8333... hours. Then multiplying that by $12 per hour: 12 * 0.8333... Let me compute that. 12 * 0.8 is 9.6, and 12 * 0.0333... is approximately 0.4. Adding those together gives 9.6 + 0.4 = 10. So that's $10 again. Okay, so that's the same result. So that seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: If she worked 60 minutes, she would earn $12. So for each minute, it's $12/60 = $0.20 per minute. Then 50 minutes would be 50 * $0.20 = $10. Yep, same answer. So all methods lead to $10. Therefore, I think that's the right answer.\n\nBut let me check if there's any possibility that the question is trying to trick me. For example, sometimes with hourly rates, there might be rules about rounding up to the nearest quarter hour or something. But the problem doesn't mention anything like that. It just says she did 50 minutes of babysitting, and asks how much she earned. So I think we can assume that she's paid for the exact amount of time she worked, prorated by the hourly rate. Therefore, $10 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had said she was paid for each full hour, then 50 minutes would be considered as 1 hour and she would earn $12, but that's not the case here. The problem states she just did 50 minutes, so we need to calculate the exact amount based on the time worked.\n\nSo, in conclusion, after verifying through multiple methods—converting minutes to a fraction of an hour, calculating the per-minute rate, and checking the decimal equivalent—all approaches confirm that Weng earned $10 for 50 minutes of babysitting at $12 per hour.\n\n**Final Answer**\nWeng earned \\boxed{10} dollars.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how much Weng earned for babysitting 50 minutes at a rate of $12 per hour, we need to calculate the fraction of an hour that 50 minutes represents and then apply that to her hourly rate.\n\n1. **Convert 50 minutes to hours**:\n   $$\n   \\frac{50}{60} = \\frac{5}{6} \\text{ hours}\n   $$\n\n2. **Calculate the earnings**:\n   $$\n   12 \\text{ dollars/hour} \\times \\frac{5}{6} \\text{ hours} = \\frac{12 \\times 5}{6} = \\frac{60}{6} = 10 \\text{ dollars}\n   $$\n\n3. **Verification by per-minute rate**:\n   - Hourly rate per minute: \n     $$\n     \\frac{12}{60} = 0.2 \\text{ dollars/minute}\n     $$\n   - Earnings for 50 minutes:\n     $$\n     50 \\times 0.2 = 10 \\text{ dollars}\n     $$\n\nBoth methods confirm that Weng earned $\\boxed{10}$ dollars.<|im_end|>",
