James writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends twice a week. I need to figure out how many pages he writes in a year. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the components here. He writes letters to 2 different friends. Each letter is 3 pages long. And he does this twice a week. So, per session, how many pages is that?\n\nWell, if he writes to 2 friends and each letter is 3 pages, then for each session, it's 2 friends multiplied by 3 pages. Let me write that out: 2 * 3 = 6 pages per session. Right? So each time he does this, whether it's once a week or twice a week, each occurrence he writes 6 pages.\n\nBut he does this twice a week. So per week, it's 2 sessions. Therefore, weekly pages would be 6 pages per session times 2 sessions per week. That would be 6 * 2 = 12 pages per week. Okay, so every week he writes 12 pages.\n\nNow, to find out how many pages he writes in a year, I need to multiply the weekly pages by the number of weeks in a year. Typically, a year has 52 weeks. Let me confirm that... Yeah, 52 weeks in a year. So 12 pages per week times 52 weeks.\n\nLet me calculate that. 12 * 52. Hmm, 10*52 is 520, and 2*52 is 104, so adding those together gives 520 + 104 = 624. So 624 pages per year?\n\nWait, let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't skip anything or miscalculate.\n\nFirst, per session: 2 friends * 3 pages = 6 pages. Then twice a week: 6 * 2 = 12 pages per week. Then 12 * 52 weeks. 12*50 is 600, and 12*2 is 24, so 600 + 24 = 624. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nIs there another way to approach this? Maybe calculate the total number of letters first?\n\nEach letter is 3 pages. How many letters does he write a year? He writes 2 letters per session (since he writes to 2 friends), twice a week. So letters per week: 2 * 2 = 4 letters per week. Then per year: 4 letters/week * 52 weeks = 208 letters. Each letter is 3 pages, so 208 * 3 = 624 pages. Yep, same answer. So that confirms it.\n\nI think that's solid. So the answer should be 624 pages a year.\n\n**Final Answer**\nJames writes a total of \\boxed{624} pages a year.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many pages James writes in a year, we can break the problem into smaller, manageable parts and calculate step by step.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Pages per session\n\nJames writes **3-page letters** to **2 different friends** in one session.  \nSo, the total number of pages he writes in one session is:\n\n$$\n2 \\text{ friends} \\times 3 \\text{ pages per letter} = 6 \\text{ pages per session}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Pages per week\n\nHe does this **twice a week**, so the total number of pages he writes in a week is:\n\n$$\n6 \\text{ pages per session} \\times 2 \\text{ sessions per week} = 12 \\text{ pages per week}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Pages per year\n\nThere are **52 weeks in a year**, so the total number of pages he writes in a year is:\n\n$$\n12 \\text{ pages per week} \\times 52 \\text{ weeks} = 624 \\text{ pages}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\n$$\n\\boxed{624}\n$$<|im_end|>",
