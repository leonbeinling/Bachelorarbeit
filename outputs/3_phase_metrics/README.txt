Metrics overview:
- accuracy.any_overlap: True if seg_labels ∩ gold_labels ≠ ∅.
- accuracy.primary: Primary-phase match (first label).
- accuracy.pred_primary_coverage: Share of sentences with a valid predicted primary phase.
- accuracy.per_phase_primary: Accuracy by gold primary phase.
- prf: Precision/Recall/F1 from the primary-phase confusion (per phase, micro, macro).
- confusion_primary: Gold×Pred confusion over primary phases (includes 'NONE' for missing primary).
- transitions: Primary-phase transition metrics (A->B) incl. confusion, top failures,
  and boundary errors (missed = gold changed, pred did not; wrong = both changed but mismatched).
- markers.top_20: Most frequent markers found in sentence text (catalog-driven search).
- markers.phase_alignment:
  - gold_start_accuracy / pred_start_accuracy / both_start_accuracy:
    share that the sentence containing a marker has Gold / Pred / Both equal to the marker’s intended phase.
  - agreement_rate: share that Gold == Pred on sentences where the marker occurs.
  - per_marker details include per-phase distributions and top phases.
- labels_overview: counts per phase for predicted vs. gold.
